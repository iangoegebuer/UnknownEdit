Unknown Edit
===========

Unknown Edit is a Starcraft/Broodwar advanced map editor for Macs that I developed at a very young age. I had a Mac and enjoyed used StarEdit to make maps, but the issue was that to make amazing maps, one would have to employ the use of an advanced map editor rather than the one that came with the game itself.

I started on this map editor to allow Mac users to make more advanced maps. It started with an edit to the Java based map editor for Windows called GUEdit. I decompiled it and begun adding functionality such as trigger editing and terrain editing and loading, which would previously crash on a mac. At this point, I finally hit a wall with what could be done and began anew with Objective-C/Cocoa.

Unknown Edit(XEdit for short) was written by me at about the age of 13. So please excuse the lack of style and propper formatting. It was my introduction to programming. I keep it here soley for the legacy of the project. I may go back one day and rewrite it all much cleaner and more efficient, but for now I am simply happy that I got a mostly functional editor working.
